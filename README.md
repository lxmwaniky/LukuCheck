-   **Backend & Database**: Leverages [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for backend services, including:
    -   Firestore as the primary NoSQL database.
    -   Firebase Authentication for user management.
    -   Firebase Storage for image uploads (e.g., profile photos).
-   **Server-Side Logic**: Core functionalities are managed in Firebase Cloud Functions (or server-side Next.js API routes) interacting with Firebase Admin SDK. Key action files include:
    -   `src/actions/outfitActions.ts`: Handles AI processing and leaderboard data.
    -   `src/actions/userActions.ts`: Manages user profiles, referrals, badges, and submission perks.

## Testing

-   **Unit Tests**: The application includes a suite of unit tests written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to ensure the reliability of server-side actions and utility functions.
-   **Running Tests**: To execute the tests, run the following command in your project terminal:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
    (If you use Yarn, the command would be `yarn test`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or higher recommended)
-   `npm` or `yarn` package manager

### Setup and Running Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lxmwaniky/LukuCheck
    cd LukuCheck
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Firebase Setup:**
    -   Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    -   Set up Firestore, Firebase Authentication (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In), and Firebase Storage.
    -   You will need to configure Firebase environment variables for the application to connect to your Firebase project. This typically involves creating a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and adding your Firebase project configuration keys (e.g., API key, auth domain, project ID). **Do not commit your actual Firebase keys to version control.**
        ```
        # Example .env.local (replace with your actual Firebase config)
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

        # For Firebase Admin SDK (server-side)
        FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_firebase_admin_client_email
        FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_firebase_admin_private_key
        ```
    *(Note: The specific environment variables needed might vary based on the project's exact Firebase Admin initialization method.)*

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
